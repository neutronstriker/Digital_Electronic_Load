One more idiotic thing that you did was that you forgot to give a little space from the 2 OHM resistors for the main Power IN header (LOAD).

Including the disconnection of the TPL0102 HA pin which should have been routed to 5V+.

Remember to check for these next time including the cutting down trace issue of AREF -A0 pin.

you could have also added an NMOS on load side to disconnect load in case of emergency.

And one more switch would be a better idea for good software UI.

Also change the I2C pullup resistors to either 4.7k or 2.2k because bus is hanging a lot because of lower pullup values.
